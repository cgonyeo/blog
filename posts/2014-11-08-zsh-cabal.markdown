I just spent a half hour messing with my `.zshrc` to make it play nicely with
cabal sandboxes, and figured I'd dump the config changes here for anyone
interested. My .zshrc in its entirety is [on my
github](https://github.com/dgonyeo/dotfiles).

The behavior I added prefixes my prompt with a light green "cabal" when I'm in
a sandbox, and modifies my path to include `./.cabal-sandbox/bin` when I'm in a
sandbox and `~/.cabal/bin` when I'm not. It does this by checking for the
existence of `./cabal.sandbox.config` whenever I change directories. Not the
most efficient thing, but I doubt the extra cycles spent checking if a file
exists will impact much.

To use, copy/paste the following blob into your config, and change the
`PROMPT=` line to whatever you want your prompt to be. It just needs to include
`$(sandbox_prompt)` in it to be able to add the "cabal" to the prompt. Also if
you'd prefer different text just change the `export
__CABAL_SANDBOX="%{$fg_bold[green]%}cabal %{$reset_color%}"` line towards the
top.

Make sure you log out and back in (or source `.zprofile`) when you do this, or
your `PATH` will all of a sudden include _only_ cabal's bin.

```zsh
# Cabal sandbox stuff
 typeset -ga chpwd_functions
 function update_cabal_sandbox_info () {
     if [[ -a cabal.sandbox.config ]]
     then              
         export __CABAL_SANDBOX="%{$fg_bold[green]%}cabal %{$reset_color%}"
     else              
         export __CABAL_SANDBOX=""
     fi                
 }                     
                       
 # Prompt              
 function set_prompt() {
     PROMPT="%(?..%{$fg_bold[red]%}%?%{$reset_color%} )$__CABAL_SANDBOX%n@%m %~> "
 }                  
                       
 # Dicking with my path for cabal sandboxes
 function cabal_bin_path() {
     if [ -z $__CABAL_SANDBOX ]
     then           
         export PATH=$PATH2:~/.cabal/bin
     else           
         export PATH=$PATH2:./.cabal-sandbox/bin:~/.cabal/bin
     fi             
 }                     
                       
 # Functions to run when the user cds
 chpwd_functions+='update_prompt_chpwd'
 update_prompt_chpwd () {
     update_cabal_sandbox_info
     cabal_bin_path 
     set_prompt     
 }                     
 update_prompt_chpwd
```

And the following needs to go in your `.zprofile`

```zsh
 export PATH2=$PATH 
```
