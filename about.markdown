title: About
---

My name is Derek Gonyeo, and I'm a third year student at
[RIT](http://www.rit.edu/) majoring in [Computer
Science](http://www.cs.rit.edu/). I'm a member of the [Computer Science
House](http://csh.rit.edu/) at RIT, and am currently its financial director

I have professional experience as a software engineer through two co-ops, one
doing iOS development at [Stormfrog](http://www.stormfrog.com/) and one working
on a notification management tool for operations at
[Hudl](http://www.hudl.com/).

I also have experience through personal projects in basic circuit design,
Android development, web backends, and some basics of distributed systems.

I'm familiar with Java, Go, C, Haskell, Python, C#, Bash, and Javascript (in
decreasing order of proficiency).
