title: About
---

My name is Derek Gonyeo, and I'm a fourth year student at
[RIT](http://www.rit.edu/) majoring in [Computer
Science](http://www.cs.rit.edu/). I'm a member and Root Type Person (sysadmin)
of the [Computer Science House](http://csh.rit.edu/) at RIT.

I have professional experience as a software engineer through multiple
internships. I started out doing iOS development at
[Stormfrog](http://www.stormfrog.com/), went from there to working on a
notification management tool for systems administrators at
[Hudl](http://www.hudl.com/), spend a semester working on an HTTP API for
[Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies](http://www.janssen.com/) through
[Xyntek Inc.](http://www.xyntekinc.com/), and am currently employed working on
[gohbase](https://github.com/tsuna/gohbase/) at
[CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

I also have experience through personal projects in basic circuit design,
Android development, web backends, and some basics of distributed systems.

I have professional experience in Go, Java, Haskell, and Python.
