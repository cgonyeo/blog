	<p>This is my response to the assignment located at
<a href="http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/hw/commarch.txt">http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/hw/commarch.txt</a>.</p>
<p>We chose to analyze the systemd project. We did have problems running
git-by-a-bus, as the systemd project is rather large. After 20 hours and about
30 GB of memory, I gave up on running the project. Information has instead been
gathered from Github's graphs on the project.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Answers</h3>
<p>Describe software project, its purpose and goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It aims to replace init, to do
this in an aggressively parallel manner, and to be a drop in replacement for
sysvinit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Give brief history of the project. When was the Initial Commit? The latest
commit?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first commit was on April 26, 2005, and the most recent commit on the
mainline was a few hours ago. The git history suggests that there were several
independent branches that became one central systemd.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who approves patches? How many people? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patches are approved through and by the systemd mailing list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who has commit access, or has had patches accepted?  How many total?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>16 people have direct commit access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who has the highest amounts of "Unique Knowledge?" (As per your "Git-by-a-bus"
report. If there is a tie, list each contributor, with links if possible)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Git-by-a-bus was unable to run due to the size of the repository. Based on the
commit graphs in Github, Lennart Poettering and Kay Sievers would have the most
intimate knowledge with the internals of the project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is your project's "Calloway Coefficient of Fail?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looks like the systemd guys are on top of their game, they have a 0 coefficient of fail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Has there been any turnover in the Core Team? (i.e. has the same top 20% of
contributors stayed the same over time? If not, how has it changed?)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It does not appear that there has been any turnover in the core team.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the project have a BDFL, or Lead Developer? (BDFL == Benevolent Dictator
for Life)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The lead developers appear to be Lennart Poettering and Kay Sievers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are the front and back end developers the same people? What is the proportion of
each?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Systemd is a low level codebase entirely written in C</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What have been some of the major bugs/problems/issues that have arisen during
development? Who is responsible for quality control and bug repair?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TODOs are handled through the mailing list, the github issue tracker is not
used. The core mailing list is responsible for quality control and bug repair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is the project's participation trending and why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would appear that the project’s activity has increased in the past few
months.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, does the project pass "The Raptor Test?" (i.e. Would the
project survive if the BDFL, or most active contributor were eaten by a
Velociraptor?) Why or why not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There appears to be two people with a massive amount of contributions to the
project, so if one of them were to be eaten by a velociraptor, the other one
would probably be able to carry on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your opinion, would the project survive if the core team, or most active 20%
of contributors, were hit by a bus? Why or why not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on the contributor graphs on Github, definitely not. There are two people
who own the majority of the commits to the project, and then about another 8 who
own almost all the rest, out of 274 contributors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?  (new
contributor guides, quickstarts, communication leads who focus specifically on
newbies, etc...) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is documentation for “Developers”, though this is more “documentation for
people using systemd for handling their code”. There is not a lot of
documentation for developers of systemd itself, except for the “systemd-devel”
mailing list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does the project have Documentation available? Is it extensive?  Does it include
code examples?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a decent amount of documentation, including example usage and
configuration settings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you were going to contribute to this project, but ran into trouble or hit
blockers, who would you contact, and how?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best places to ask questions would be in the IRC channel (#systemd on
Freenode), the mailing list, or the Google+ community</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Based on these answers, how would you describe the decision making
structure/process of this group?  Is it hierarchical, consensus building, ruled
by a small group, barely contained chaos, or ruled by a single or pair of
individuals?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s controlled by some linux wizards and their mailing list. The mailing list
is archived and well documented but you need to be a part of that community if
you want to contribute</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is this the kind of structure you would enjoy working in? Why, or why not?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joining the developers seems to have a difficult start, and the majority of work
from people outside the core developer group involves sending the patches to a
mailing list, which is also used for discussion about usage and development.
These are factors that could be considered a large turn-off from new growth.</p>
