__What are the similarities between Weber's eight principles, and the five
pillars?__

>Both lists rely heavily on the fact that there's a lot of people involved in
>the open source community. The pillars include an open exchange of ideas
>between people, and the principles say to talk a lot, and document what you
>do. Both of these emphasize the communication within this community, and
>describe it's importance. The pillars also include participation, which is
>effectively what the principle "Solve problems through parallel work
>processess whenever possible" relies upon; through the participation of many
>people, it is possible to solve problems concurrently. Additionally, the pillar 
>of "Rapid Prototyping" and the principle of "Release early and release often"
>are pretty much the same thing.

__What are the differences?__

>The principles discuss the problems related to incentivizing people, most
>obviously in the one titled "Make it interesting and make sure it happens". The
>pillars don't touch on this, as if they assume that individuals are self or
>outside modivated, and as such don't need a push from the organizers of these
>open source projects to get involved; being involved would be its own reward.
