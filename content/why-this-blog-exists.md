Summary: Why this blog exists

Hi! I'm Derek. I like to do technical things, and I'm going to use this blog as 
a means of documenting what I've done. This is both so I can remember how I've 
done things, and so maybe someday one of my ramblings will help someone with 
some problem they're solving.
