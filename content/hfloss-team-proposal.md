Summary: The Team Proposal for the HFOSS Commarch assignment

For the commarch assignment, I will be working with Matt Soucy and Dylan Ayrey.
I will be tasked with getting [Git by a
bus](https://github.com/tomheon/git_by_a_bus), calculating the [Callaway
Coefficient of
Fail](http://hfoss-fossrit.rhcloud.com/static/books/tomspotcallaway-howtotellifyourfossprojectisdoomedtofail.pdf),
and answering the corresponding questions under part 4. The others will do the
remaining questions in the assignment.

For our project, we will be analyzing the
[Systemd](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) community. Systemd is
described as:

    Systemd is a service manager for linux. It handles daemonization and
    parallelization to help ease services.

We will be able to communicate with the project via their mailing list at
[http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel](http://lists.freedesktop.org/mailman/listinfo/systemd-devel),
and via their IRC channel #systemd on Freenode. 

The easy parts will probably be:

    - Git by a bus 
    - Callaway Coefficient of Fail
    - Describe software project, its purpose and goals.

The hard parts will probably be:

    - Detecting turnover in the core team
    - Determining raptor/bus tests
    - Does the project have an official "on-boarding" process in place?

Hard parts can probably be resolved easily enough by asking questions in irc
channels, and git by a bus may help highlight some interesting dynamics of the
community.
