Summary: Week 1 of HFOSS at RIT

The HFOSS class finally pushed me to get my blog up and running. I'm using 
[pelican](docs.getpelican.com) to generate the pages and host it in Amazon S3.
Very little work was left to be done to finish the blog, really just add 
disqus, google analytics, plug it into s3, and write some content. I had set up
most of it earlier and then never finished the project (like far too many 
things I do).

It'll document my adventures and discoveries both within and outside of the 
class.
