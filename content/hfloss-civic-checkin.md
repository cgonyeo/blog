Summary: Thoughts on the check-in for the Civic App Challenge

For class last week we attended the check-in for the AT&T Rochester Civic App 
Hackathon. During it Remy Decausemaker went over the goals and rules of the 
hackathon, and participants gave short talks on what they were working on and
what kind of people they were looking for to help. 

There were some cool ideas there, but the one that caught my attention most was
an app to help bus goers. The premise was that a real-time schedule for when
buses would arrive would be very nice, but the company running the buses won't
release an api for this. To circumvent this, this app was being developed. It
would crowdsource this information; if people ran this app, and it had at least
one person on a reasonable amount of buses, then the current location and
schedule of the buses would be available.

This is an event I'd love to have participated in (particularly seeing the
prizes and apparent small pool of people participating), but I have far too many
things to do to get involved in a 2 month long hackathon. At least Hack Upstate
in Syracuse will be happening in about a month.
