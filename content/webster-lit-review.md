Summary: I detail my thoughts on a chapter about the Open Source process

As an assignment for the HFOSS course at RIT, I am to read the third chapter
from Webster's Success of Open Source. The following is my (albeit late) review
of the text.

The chapter provides an overview of how the collaborative process in Open Source
works, why it works, and some of the key elements of its success. From its
conception in 1994, Linux has grown into a widely used operating system. During
this time, the collaborative process among the developers supporting it and
related projects has evolved into am impressive example of the kinds of progress
that can be made relying on free labor and the increased levels collaboration
the internet allows.

The authors details eight principles that attempt to detail what people do in
the open source process. These principles are:

    1 Make it interesting and make sure it happens
    2 Scratch an itch
    3 Minimize how many times you have to reinvent the wheel
    4 Solve problems through parallel work processes whenever possible
    5 Leverage the law of large numbers
    6 Document what you do
    7 Release early and release often
    8 Talk a lot

I found some of the data and graphs provided by the author interesting,
specifically the graphs detailing that Finland has the highest per capita
contributions to the open source cause. The principles laid out by the author
felt like a good summary of how to best understand what happens and know what to
expect when contributing to an open source project.

I wasn't overly fond of some of the authors verbose language, and found myself
wishing he had instead opted to skip some of his example. I believe his ultimate
message was accurate however, so his examples ultimately serve as a means to
that end.

I give this chapter 4 out of 5
